# Workshop Snack app (GDGReading)

This is a react native application with the scope to be used on the GDG Reading workshop.

The goal are the attendants to create a mobile app that displays a list of poems and to be able to read the poems.

It includes some basic functionality and the attendants should add more code to make the project complete.

The result they should get is similar to the code that can be found in the following [repo](https://github.com/lampropoi/Poems)

The data for each song, which currently are just dummy data stored in a Google spreadsheet we should use the [GraphQLSheet app](https://graphqlsheet.com/) to fetch them.

This project is exported from Snack :)
